# Bugs

  1) (May not be a problem) The lexer will not handle files that are not 0 indented properly. The problem is, if there is a comment that start at column 0, but the first real declaration starts at say column 2, the lexer will use column 0 as default. Lexer does not know to ignore comments (I think).

  2) Lexer reports wrong locations

  3) Token parser should return Lexemes instead of tokens


# TODO

  1) grep for "TODO"

  2) Consider adding warnings to the Compiler monad (using a writer monad perhaps)

  7) Lexer and Happy should use CompilerError

  8) Language.Sill.TypeChecker.Subtyping has a lot of duplication in code. Error
  messages are also duplicated.

  9) Location of error messages need to be greatly improved


# Type checker

  1) When we expect only one branch to be true, we should have a message that says
     one of these needs to hold (rather than just listing them)

  2) The subtyping algorithm is wacky. Read the TODO.

  3) Case for decomposeTarget intersection is broken
